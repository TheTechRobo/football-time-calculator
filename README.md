# football-time-calculator
I don't like football, but here's a calculator to convert from "football time" to approx. real time.

# Usage
```
>>> from footballTimeCalculator import *
>>> calculateFootballTimeToReal(original_number)
```

Or, if you prefer it to be interactive, run `main.py`.

# Todo
Turn into an app with GUI.
